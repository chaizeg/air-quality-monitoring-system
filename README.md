# air-quality-monitoring-system
Arduino project for an IoT air quality monitoring system. 
The system uses an Arduino Uno, an ESP8622 Wifi module to connect to an IoT platform (TBD, possibly ThingSpeak or Azure's IoT hub), an MQ5 gas sensor to determine air quality.
Certain open-source Arduino libraries have to imported (for MQ5 and the Grove LCD ).
